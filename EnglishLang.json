Every two months, in game time, the possibility to investigate a rumor will open up from the Exploits tab on your hackshop page.\n\nAfter the investigation is accepted, you’ll receive an email with information about the network where one of the rumors was detected. Upon accessing the network, your task is to investigate the origin of the rumor. When the source is identified, a partial IP address will be revealed. At this point, you’ll need to team up with another player who’s also investigating a rumor to obtain the full address. In single-player mode, the full address will be provided directly.\n\nWith the full IP address, you’ll gain access to another network where the engineers who designed the libraries work. Your goal is to convince one of them to grant you access to a debug-mode library, which could expose potential zero-day <color=orange>exploits</color>.\n\nWith the credentials, you can access the library’s debug mode via <color=orange>metalib.debug_tools</color>, which returns an object of type <color=orange>DebugLibrary</color>. This allows you to scan the library for possible code errors that may lead to <color=#33cccc>vulnerabilities</color>. After the scan, a fragment of code containing errors will be reported. Once you identify the faulty lines, you can proceed with the <color=orange>unit_testing</color> method.\n\nUsing <color=orange>unit_testing</color>, automated tests will be run on the specified code lines. If potential <color=#33cccc>vulnerabilities</color> are uncovered due to existing errors, partial objects that could be exploited will be printed, along with details about the affected memory region and the specifics of the new vulnerability.\n\nWith this information, you can invoke <color=orange>metalib.payload</color>. This method returns a list containing a single partial object of type Computer if any zero-day <color=#33cccc>vulnerabilities</color> are found in the targeted memory area. If a file path is specified, its associated partial object of type File will also be added to the list. Furthermore, if the file is a library, its metalib object will be included in the returned list.\n\nIf any new vulnerability is discovered, along with the partial objects of type Computer and File, you’ll have the option to enforce specific requirements for existing or newly discovered <color=#33cccc>vulnerabilities</color>. However, no changes made through the partial objects will be applied to the victim’s device until a system library is successfully exploited.

    "FILE_LORE_1": "In 1972, the UNIX operating system was rewritten in the programming language C, opening the possibility for other programmers to create their own operating system variants. \n\nDuring the following years different companies bought licenses in order to distribute their own versions of the operating system. Despite the great popularity of Linux after its creation in 1992, and despite it being open source, it was eventually surpassed by a similar operating system with certain peculiarities.\n\nIn 1994 the company Neurobox published its closed source operating system called Ellipse along with an SDK. To date, the names of the programmers behind the project have not been made public. Although the system was initially derived from UNIX, the changes to the source were so substantial that it is now considered a system similar to UNIX, rather than a branch of it.",
    "FILE_LORE_02": "Last Thursday night, the murder of Jessie Rees, a computer programmer linked to the development of the popular Ellipse operating system, was reported. \n\nAlthough Neurobox never made the names of the people involved public, police investigators suspects that Jessie Rees was affiliated with the company for several years. \n\nThe police are not sharing any other details at this time, but this investigation could potentially expose new information about this secretive company and its popular operating system.",
    "FILE_LORE_03": "Every time Jessie Rees is talked about, more questions arise about what really happened.\n\nNeurobox quickly dissociated itself from the problem, police said that after a \"thorough\" investigation nothing had been found that could link the company to the death of Jessie Rees. This was only two days after.\nThe case was eventually closed as a suicide, although there was some evidence that did not fit, such as that the handwriting on the note did not correspond to Rees' handwriting, as well as the glass that had recently been replaced in the front door.\n\nHe was hired by Neurobox and moved into the facilities they have available to employees. According to some documents found in Rees' house, this seems to have been an essential requirement to be able to work in the company.\n\nAs it was later revealed, Rees had been one of the engineers in charge of designing the Ellipse kernel, but certain problems with the company, the details of which have not been disclosed, led to his dismissal shortly before Ellipse was released to the public.",

    "FILE_LORE_06": "Ellipse was conceived to mainly be used in the corporate sphere, and its strengths were security and portability since it was possible to install the system in different architectures with few changes to the code. To achieve this, the whole system was rewritten in a programming language called Greyscript along with its own closed source compiler. Its peculiar implementation made it really difficult to infect or exploit, in part because nobody managed to create a reliable decompiler for Greyscript. \n\nIn a cryptic message released on the web in 1996, the company announced that Ellipse where to be made available for both personal and commercial use completely free without any licensing. The secrecy surrounding Neurobox along with several cryptic messages published by the company, has spawned numerous theories about the company’s origin and agenda while also boosting the popularity of the operating system. ",

Their response was the last public message by the company to date: \n\n“Everything under control”\n\nLess than 24 hours later a patch was released that fixed the vulnerability. Since then, new vulnerabilities keep appearing, several of which have been connected to corporate espionage and bank heists among other things. To this day the company is stuck in a perpetual cycle of finding and patching these never-ending flaws.\n\nOne popular theory is that Neurobox themselves are behind the security flaws, but what they would have to gain from doing this and why they continue to patch their system if that were the case, remains unclear. Meanwhile, the many years of silence from Neurobox since the hacking surge began, continue to inspire new conspiracy theories about the company.",

I say that we continue gaining time and make sure that people identify Ellipse as a reliable system during all the time we can.

If you forgot to save the <color=orange>CTFEvent</color> object after creating it, you can also get it with the general.<color=#0FABFFFF>get_ctf</color> method.\n\n<color=#33cccc>Description</color>: Text about the event that will be visible for the rest of the players.\n\n<color=#33cccc>CreatorName</color>: Choose the name you want to be publicly accessible by other players next to the event description. Note that must be different from the user used to create the event to prevent other players from attempting to bruteforce to obtain your event admin credentials.\n\n<color=#33cccc>MailContent</color>: When a player accepts your CTF they will receive an email with additional information about the event such as detailed instructions to start the event.\n\n<color=#33cccc>Template</color>: IP address of a rental of your property that will be used as a template for the event. When a player accepts the event, a clone network of the one you have provided as a template will be spawned, in this way each player will have their independent instance of the network and it prevents players from interfering with each other if they access the same default network .\n\n<b>Note</b>: These networks will have various limitations compared to normal networks to prevent various abuses. These limitations will be defined during the development of the nightly build.\n\n<b>3 -</b> During the design of the mission you must decide when the player has to call the <color=orange>CTFEvent</color>.<color=#0FABFFFF>player_success</color> method to indicate to the system that the player has completed the event correctly.\n\n<b>4 -</b> We already have our event configured! It is time to <color=#0FABFFFF>publish</color> it so that it is visible to the whole world. To do this, from the <color=orange>CTFEvent</color> object, it calls the <color=#0FABFFFF>publish</color> method, if everything went well it will return true, otherwise a string will be returned with the error detail.\n\n<b>5 -</b> Once the event is created, any player can access it from the main page of the web browser, by clicking on the icon at the top right of the window.\n\nAnd everything is ready. The reward for completing the event is decided automatically depending on the rate of the players and the number of times the event has been successfully completed. The event creator also receives a percentage of the player's reward each time the event is completed.",

To be honest, $NPC works like three people; we have to acknowledge that the company made a great hire. If $NPC keeps lightening my workload, I'm delighted!\nWell, if you need anything else, you know where to find me.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_2": "I was going through the documentation this morning, and I have to say, it was a breeze thanks to the organization $NPC did. Usually, I go crazy trying to find the right files, but this time everything was exactly where it needed to be. Seriously, I saved an incredible amount of time because of their attention to detail. Don't tell anyone that I'm going to seem unnecessary! :P",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_1": "Ugh dude, there's still a while to go before finishing the work, I'm bored. When we're done, I'm going to grab a drink with the guys at the bar. Are you in?\nBy the way, have you seen the latest screw-up by $NPC? Haha! I already warned him that he shouldn't make those changes without consulting the boss, but as always, he didn't listen to me. If he keeps this up, it looks like he'll have to find another job soon.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_2": "What a day… not sure if you noticed, but we had to redo part of the work because $NPC didn’t follow the instructions correctly. We were making good progress, and then suddenly everything went off track because of a little mistake on their part. I mean, it’s not the end of the world, but with a bit more care, it could’ve been avoided. I’m trying not to lose my patience, but it’s tough sometimes.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_3": "I was thinking about how the event went last week, and honestly, we wouldn’t have pulled it off without $NPC. First one in and last one out, making sure everything was ready. And not just that, $NPC handled a couple of last-minute issues without breaking a sweat. It’s great to know there’s always someone ready to step up when needed.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_3": "I still can’t believe we have to redo the entire presentation. And all because $NPC didn’t double-check the numbers before sending them over. We’re already behind schedule, and this just makes it worse. The thing is, this isn’t the first time something like this has happened, and it doesn’t seem like there’s a serious approach to these mistakes. I’m considering talking to the team to see if responsibilities can be split up more effectively.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_4": "Here’s the project update. Honestly I don’t know what I would’ve done without $NPC. Just when the server went down, $NPC stepped in and fixed it in no time. Good thing because with all the chaos we had yesterday the last thing we needed was another crisis. Don’t worry about the rest, it’s all sorted now thanks to that quick thinking.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_4": "Just got out of the meeting, and… wow, what a mess. Guess who showed up late again and didn’t even bother to check the data before presenting? Yep, $NPC. I don’t know how we’re supposed to pull off this project if $NPC keeps treating things so casually. At least I got a laugh out of watching the boss try to make sense of those charts…",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_5": "Yesterday I had an interesting chat with $NPC. Came up with a pretty solid idea to speed up the order delivery process. Got me thinking about how slow we’ve been lately. I think if we implement it we could cut the delivery time almost in half. It’s nice having someone around who’s always looking to make things better.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_5": "Not sure if you’ve noticed, but there’s been a lot of work piling up lately. Not to point fingers, but $NPC always seems to dodge the most important tasks. Just today, when the reports needed to be prepped, $NPC was “busy” with something that seemed anything but urgent. At this rate we’re going to end up doing double the work ourselves.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_6": "I had to step out for a bit today for something personal, and when I got back, everything was already done. Guess who took care of it: $NPC. Always seems to anticipate any problem and jumps right in without being asked. Having someone like that around really makes work so much easier. Seriously, sometimes I wonder how we managed before $NPC showed up.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_6": "Not sure if you’ve had to work with $NPC lately, but every time I ask for something to be done it ends up taking twice as long as I expected. $NPC is a good person, don’t get me wrong, but sometimes it feels like there’s just a bit too much of a laid-back attitude. And then we end up rushing to get everything done on time. Hopefully the pace picks up soon or this is going to be an issue.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_7": "I had a rough day with clients today and honestly didn’t expect to get all the work done on time. But $NPC stopped by my office and offered to help with what was left. Not only did we finish ahead of schedule, but $NPC even shared a couple of ideas to improve the process in the future. It’s a real pleasure working with someone so proactive.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_7": "I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but once again today, $NPC dropped everything because of something “urgent” that needed attention. It’s not the first time this has happened and meanwhile the rest of us have to cover those tasks. At first I thought it was just bad luck, but it seems like this is becoming the standard. Maybe we should talk to someone to put a stop to it.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_8": "I was thinking about how chaotic last quarter’s close was, and thank goodness $NPC took the initiative to organize all the submissions. In the end thanks to that everything went way smoother than I expected. I don’t know how they’re so good at staying calm when everyone else is stressed out, but I really appreciate it.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_8": "Today while we were all rushing to get ready for the meeting, $NPC started going over things that had nothing to do with it. And of course we ended up having to help finish that part, otherwise we wouldn’t have made it on time. I appreciate the effort to be thorough, but that wasn’t the time for it… Hopefully next time $NPC focuses on what’s important before getting into the details.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_9": "Yesterday I was working with $NPC on the new project, and I’d say the work was handled pretty well. Not that it’s a miracle, but at least $NPC knows the way around and doesn’t miss much. I think if this keeps up, we’ll be able to get the work done without too much trouble.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_9": "I still don’t get how $NPC can spend an entire morning on just one task. I’m not trying to put pressure on anyone but we’re all trying to speed things up, and then I find their part is still not ready. I don’t know maybe they need a bit of help getting organized or something, because at this rate, we’re not moving forward.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_10": "I’ve been working a bit with $NPC this week. Not the fastest around, but there’s definitely effort put into getting things right. Sometimes it takes a bit longer but that’s better than having to fix mistakes later. I think if $NPC keeps adapting there will be a good fit with the rest of the team.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_10": "Today I had to go over what $NPC did and found a few mistakes I had already pointed out before. Not serious issues, but it’s worrying that there isn’t enough attention to detail. I hope it was just a bad day, but if this keeps up we’re going to have to talk to the boss.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_11": "The other day I bumped into $NPC while finishing up the last review of the database. It wasn’t even part of $NPC’s task but a quick look was enough to spot a couple of mistakes that would’ve taken me ages to find. Not sure if helping with those things is part of the role, but I appreciate the initiative.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_11": "I don’t know what happened with $NPC, but yesterday some documents needed to be uploaded and ended up in a format no one can open. Sometimes I wonder if there’s a check before sending things. It’s not a big issue, I fixed it quickly, but I hope there’s more care next time.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_12": "Today I ran into $NPC in the break room and we started talking about ways to improve the order tracking system. It might not be the final solution, but $NPC brought up some interesting ideas we could try out. I like that there’s always something to contribute, even if it’s not exactly the area of work.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_12": "Not sure if you’ve noticed but $NPC hasn’t updated the records in a few days. I noticed it when I tried to find the info for the last report and it wasn’t up to date. It’s not a complete disaster, but we’re already behind and these little things don’t help. Hopefully we can sort it out soon.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_13": "I was talking to $NPC about the flexible schedule thing. It seems there’s a way to organize time to be available when needed most, without affecting the work. Not sure if it’s the best solution for everyone but it’s nice to see an effort to adjust to the team’s needs.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_13": "I had to finish the presentation myself today because $NPC didn’t make it on time. Mentioned having an issue but this is the third time something like this has happened this month. I’m starting to think there isn’t much commitment to the project. Hopefully $NPC finds a way to organize better because work is just piling up.",
    "WORKMAIL_BAD_14": "I was looking over the documents $NPC left last week, and it took a while to figure out what the intention was. Not sure if it was done in a rush or if attention to detail was just lacking, but it would be great to leave things a bit clearer. It’d make life easier for all of us.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_14": "I was going over the team’s progress, and although $NPC doesn’t usually stand out, all tasks assigned are always completed. It’s not like $NPC goes above and beyond, but at least you can count on the work to be done without issues. Maybe it’s better to have someone like that than someone unpredictable.",
    "WORKMAIL_GOOD_15": "Today I ran into $NPC and we talked about ways to simplify client management. It’s not like there’s a perfect solution but at least there’s some thought about how to improve things, and that’s a good start. If we manage to apply any of those ideas we could save time on those tasks.",
    "WORKMAIL_MISSIONS_1": "Hey! How's your day going? I finally just finished that thing that kept me busy all weekend. Everything is fine, but while I was working these past few days, I saw something that seemed suspicious on the computer $LOCAL_IP and I'm not sure if I should report it.",
    "WORKMAIL_MISSIONS_2": "Hey, not sure if you’ve noticed, but while going over some stuff this morning, I came across something strange at $LOCAL_IP. I’m not sure what it means, but maybe you should check it out. You know how these things make me nervous, so I’d rather make sure everything’s fine.",
    "WORKMAIL_MISSIONS_3": "Have you checked out $LOCAL_IP lately? I saw something there that didn’t quite add up, though it’s probably nothing. Maybe I’m just being paranoid but I thought I’d mention it just in case.",
    "WORKMAIL_MISSIONS_4": "Hey, the other day I heard someone mention $LOCAL_IP like it was something interesting. I have no idea what they were talking about, but it stuck with me. It’s probably nothing, but I thought I’d mention it in case you want to check it out.",
    "WORKMAIL_MISSIONS_5": "While I was working, I noticed someone wrote down $LOCAL_IP on a post-it and stuck it on the desk. There was nothing else written, just the address. Makes me wonder if there’s any reason behind it… Just thought I’d let you know.",
    "WORKMAIL_MISSIONS_6": "I saw a piece of paper lying around with $LOCAL_IP scribbled on it. No one’s told me anything about it, but it caught my eye, like it was jotted down quickly. Probably nothing important, but it left me wondering.",
    "WORKMAIL_MISSIONS_7": "While tidying up the office, I found an old file with $LOCAL_IP written in the corner. There weren’t any details or instructions, just the address. It seemed odd for it to be there...",
    "WORKMAIL_BREAK_1": "By the way! I forgot to mention earlier that if your work schedule coincides with mine, we can meet in the break room. I have my break at $TIME, we can have a coffee and keep talking about that?",
    "WORKMAIL_BREAK_2": "Hey, since we have that conversation pending, how about we talk during the break? Mine is at $TIME, so if that works for you, we can meet in the break room and catch up for a bit.",
    "WORKMAIL_BREAK_3": "I’ve been thinking about what you mentioned, and I think we could discuss it better during the break. I usually take mine at $TIME, so if you’re free around then, we can make the most of it and go over it properly.",

    "WORKMAIL_ADMIN_GOOD_2": "I was having some trouble accessing certain programs, but it seems $NPC fixed it before I even noticed. Sometimes I don’t even realize something’s wrong because it gets handled so quickly it just goes unnoticed.",
    "WORKMAIL_ADMIN_BAD_2": "Not sure if anyone else is experiencing this, but lately the computers have been a bit slow. Maybe $NPC hasn’t had time to check it out, but I hope they can take a look soon. It’s getting hard to work with so many slowdowns.",
