Go to the <color=yellow>/var</color> folder and double click on the <color=yellow>system.log</color> file.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the deletion of the records is only useful when a <color=orange>passive trace</color> occurs.\n\nThere are two types of traces an administrator can perform: <color=orange>Active trace</color> and <color=orange>Passive trace</color>.\n\n<mark=#00D0124D><b>[Active Trace]</b></mark>\n\nIt occurs only when the administrator of a system is logged into the computer you have accessed. \nThe way to stop this tracking if it has already started is to disconnect from the remote machine, at which point the <color=orange>passive trace</color> will begin.\n\nSystem administrators, like any other worker, have a work schedule.\nIt is usually advisable to access remote machines at times when the administrator is not working.\n\nTo know if an administrator or any other user is present in a system you can use the ps command. If there is a process called dsession it means that the user to whom the process belongs is active on the machine.\n\nPrograms like <color=#0FABFFFF>AdminMonitor</color> notify you in an automated way when an administrator is present and the approximate time remaining until an <color=orange>active trace</color> reaches you.\n\n<mark=#00D0124D><b>[Passive Trace]</b></mark>\n\nIt occurs after a failed <color=orange>active trace</color>, or when the administrator goes to work and checks the logs to find suspicious activity. \nThe records of the systems by which the intruder has been jumping until arriving at the origin are analyzed.\n\nIt is advisable to break the chain of connections at any point so that the administrator can not reach you.\nThese types of traces are much slower than <color=orange>active trace</color>s.\n\n<mark=#00D0124D><b>[How to avoid being caught]</b></mark>\n\nIt is important that you remove any traces that may incriminate you in an unauthorized connection. In the current version of the game you just have to delete any entry in the file <color=yellow>/var</color>/<color=yellow>system.log</color> that is either <color=#33cccc>shell obtained</color> or <color=#33cccc>file deleted</color> along with your IP address.\n\nIf the <color=#0FABFFFF>AdminMonitor</color> program warns you that a admin has started an <color=orange>active trace</color> against you it is important that you try to delete the indicated entries and disconnect before the end of the countdown. \n\nDo not delete the entire log, since inevitably when you disconnect from the machine you will create an entry in the log with your disconnection, creating the file if you had deleted it.\n\nIf an administrator sees a log file with only a disconnect entry, he will suspect and start the trace against you.\n\n<mark=#00D0124D><b>[How to avoid being caught]</b></mark> (advanced)\n\nKeep in mind that if you connect directly to the victim machine, you will not have much reaction time if an administrator starts tracking you. \n\nIt is advisable to use at least one computer to connect to the victim. For example, if you have a rented computer, you can connect to it and from there to the victim machine. In that case you are using a <color=orange>bounce</color> to connect to the remote machine.\n\nYou can use as many computers as you want to create these chains of connections (<color=orange>bounce</color>s) until you reach the victim.\n\nIn this way, the more <color=orange>bounce</color>s you use, the administrator who is tracking you more time will spend to reach you.\n\nThen to eliminate your traces you can completely delete the file <color=yellow>/var</color>/<color=yellow>system.log</color> from any machine you have used as a <color=orange>bounce</color>.\n\nOr alternatively you can also remove from the log of any <color=orange>bounce</color> the entry that indicates a <color=#33cccc>redirection</color> from one ip to the next <color=orange>bounce</color>.

    "FILE_LORE_1": "In 1972, the UNIX operating system was rewritten in the programming language C, opening the possibility for other programmers to create their own operating system variants. \n\nDuring the following years different companies bought licenses in order to distribute their own versions of the operating system. Despite the great popularity of Linux after its creation in 1992, and despite it being open source, it was eventually surpassed by a similar operating system with certain peculiarities.\n\nIn 1994 the company Neurobox published its closed source operating system called Ellipse along with an SDK. To date, the names of the programmers behind the project have not been made public. Although the system was initially derived from UNIX, the changes to the source were so substantial that it is now considered a system similar to UNIX, rather than a branch of it.",

This was only two days after.\nThe case was eventually closed as a suicide, although there was some evidence that did not fit, such as that the handwriting on the note did not correspond to Rees' handwriting, as well as the glass that had recently been replaced in the front door.\n\nHe was hired by Neurobox and moved into the facilities they have available to employees. According to some documents found in Rees' house, this seems to have been an essential requirement to be able to work in the company.\n\nAs it was later revealed, Rees had been one of the engineers in charge of designing the Ellipse kernel, but certain problems with the company, the details of which have not been disclosed, led to his dismissal shortly before Ellipse was released to the public.",

    "FILE_LORE_06": "Ellipse was conceived to mainly be used in the corporate sphere, and its strengths were security and portability since it was possible to install the system in different architectures with few changes to the code. To achieve this, the whole system was rewritten in a programming language called Greyscript along with its own closed source compiler. Its peculiar implementation made it really difficult to infect or exploit, in part because nobody managed to create a reliable decompiler for Greyscript. \n\nIn a cryptic message released on the web in 1996, the company announced that Ellipse where to be made available for both personal and commercial use completely free without any licensing. The secrecy surrounding Neurobox along with several cryptic messages published by the company, has spawned numerous theories about the company’s origin and agenda while also boosting the popularity of the operating system. ",
    "FILE_LORE_07": "In 1998 the first major vulnerability in Ellipse was discovered, this vulnerability had been exploited for months until it was discovered, which led to harsh criticism of the company. Their response was the last public message by the company to date: \n\n“Everything under control”\n\nLess than 24 hours later a patch was released that fixed the vulnerability. Since then, new vulnerabilities keep appearing, several of which have been connected to corporate espionage and bank heists among other things. To this day the company is stuck in a perpetual cycle of finding and patching these never-ending flaws.\n\nOne popular theory is that Neurobox themselves are behind the security flaws, but what they would have to gain from doing this and why they continue to patch their system if that were the case, remains unclear. Meanwhile, the many years of silence from Neurobox since the hacking surge began, continue to inspire new conspiracy theories about the company.",
